"""The paged KV cache manager's bookkeeping, without an engine or a GPU.

These run against a real `BlockPool` and a real `FullAttentionManager`
subclass, so they check the manager against vLLM's actual allocator rather
than a stand-in. What they are looking for, in order of how quietly each would
fail:

- blocks are genuinely returned to the pool, not merely nulled in the request's
  list. A manager that forgot `free_blocks` would look correct in every
  structural assertion and save no memory at all, which is the whole point.
- the list keeps its length and its positions, because the token at position p
  lives at index p // block_size and everything from slot mapping to appends
  depends on that staying true.
- the in-tree range helper is *not* used, since it stops at the first already
  nulled block and would silently free nothing on a second, non-contiguous
  eviction.
