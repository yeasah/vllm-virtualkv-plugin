"""Prove the residency guard fires, one deliberate fault at a time.

A guard nobody has watched fail is a comment. This runs a real engine and
injects, per arm, exactly one of the mistakes the allocator will be able to
make, then checks that the guard reports *that* check and that a clean run
reports nothing:

    clean       nothing injected                  -> no violations
    stray       a resident entry points at a block the request does not own
                (what a freed-and-reallocated block looks like from the
                worker's side, which is the failure with nothing to announce
                it)                               -> ownership
    tailswap    the partial tail is moved out of last place, so this step's
                own key is written into a block the kernel no longer treats as
                the tail                          -> write_target
    shortview   a block is dropped from the row without shortening seq_len, so
                the kernel reads one entry past the resident set
                                                  -> length
    overlap     one request's view is given a block belonging to another
                                                  -> exclusivity (and
                                                     ownership, which is the
                                                     same event seen twice)

The faults are injected in the same place a pager would impose residency --
after `prepare_attn`, on the gathered view -- so the guard is being tested
against the surface it will actually watch, not a mock of it.
