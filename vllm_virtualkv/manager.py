"""A KV cache manager that keeps only part of a request's context resident.

Registered rather than patched: `KVCacheSpecRegistry.register` takes
out-of-tree specs and managers, so this is a plugin and vLLM is unmodified --
which matters given how much churn the KV subsystem has been under.

What it does each step is decide, from the shared policy, which of a request's
full blocks should be resident, and hand the rest back to the pool. The blocks
stay in `req_to_blocks` as `null_block`, so the list keeps its length and every
positional invariant the rest of the engine relies on: appends still land at
the end, `get_num_blocks_to_allocate` still counts correctly, and the token at
position p still belongs to index p // block_size.

**It does not reuse `_remove_blocks_in_range`.** That helper iterates backward
and stops at the first block already nulled, which is right for a sliding
window -- whose freed region only ever grows from the front -- and wrong here,
where the freed set is whatever the policy did not choose and can gain holes
anywhere. Calling it on a range whose tail is already null would free nothing
and report success.

Restores use the same shape the in-tree copy-on-write redirect does: reserve
the extra block in `get_num_blocks_to_allocate`, draw it in
`allocate_new_blocks`, and write it into the row *in place* rather than
appending. That keeps every positional invariant while still handing the block
to the worker through the ordinary new-block channel.

The worker learns which logical index each restored block belongs to without a
protocol change, because the pairing is implied: restored blocks are returned
before appended ones and in ascending index order, so the first `len(restored)`
new ids pair with `sorted(pending_restores)`. `restored[request_id]` records
that pairing on this side so the two can be checked against each other rather
than assumed equal.

Eviction is two-phase: a block chosen this step is freed on the *next* one, so
there is a step in which it is still allocated, still holds its contents, and
is already out of the view -- which is the window the worker copies it to the
host in. Freeing in the same pass that decided it would hand the block to
another request before anything had read it, and that failure is silent.
