"""The worker half: move the bytes, then show the kernel the resident set.

Everything else in this package decides things. This is the part that acts, and
the order it acts in is the whole correctness argument:

    1. copy in    a block the manager restored this step holds whatever the
                  pool last left in it until this runs, and the forward is
                  about to read it
    2. copy out   a block chosen for eviction is still allocated and still
                  intact for exactly one step; this is that step
    3. view       hand the attention metadata builder its own shortened
                  `seq_lens` and block table
    4. guard      check the view names nothing it does not own

**The view goes to the metadata builder, never to `input_batch.seq_lens`.**
That field means two things at once: how many keys attention reads, and how far
through its prompt the request is -- `gpu/sample/sampler.py` classifies a row
with `seq_len < prefill_len` as still prefilling and emits no token for it. A
pager is exactly the thing that needs those two numbers to differ, so shortening
the shared tensor does not fail, it *hangs*: the row stops producing tokens, is
rescheduled forever, and the engine spins with the progress bar at zero.
`CommonAttentionMetadata` carries its own `seq_lens` and `block_table_tensor`
and has a `replace()`, so the kernel can be shown a shorter context while the
rest of the engine keeps seeing the real one.

It hooks `prepare_attn` *after* the real one, which is what keeps this step's
own KV write correct for free: the slot mapping was computed from the untouched
row, so the new key lands in the tail block, which is always resident and
always last. Nothing here has to reason about writes at all.

Steps 1 and 3 are both before the forward, which is safe for a reason worth
stating: the forward writes only the tail block, and an evicted block is never
the tail. If that ever stops being true -- a policy that evicts the block being
written -- the copy-out would race the write, so the resident set including the
tail is an invariant the guard checks rather than a convention.
